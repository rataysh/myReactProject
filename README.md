# This is a project for my portfolio

## [Pizza Shop](https://rataysh.github.io/myReactProject/)

## I used the following set of tools to create this project:
### 1) Typescript 
- the entire project is made with typescript
- custom interfaces/typescript
### 2) React 
- Using basic hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef).
- Transferring data via props, callback, context, redux.
- Creating reusable components 
- Version with backend (in the same repository), also working with API via fetch
### 3) redux-toolkit
- Creating store, slice, reducers
- Interacting with data through useAppDispatch, useAppSelector
- Working with API using createAsyncThunk (theoretical knowledge of RTK Query)
### 4) Tailwind CSS.
- All styling of your project is done with this framework
- adaptive layout 
- animation
- Tailwind @apply
### 5) Git
- add, commit, push
- work with branchs (checkout, merge)
### 6) Teamwork
- Teamwork with backend developer
